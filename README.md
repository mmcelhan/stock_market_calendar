# stock_market_calendar
Program that, given a date, returns if the stock market is open. This can be done by calling the class with a method:


MarketOpen('date').market_open

such as

MarketOpen('2023-05-29').market_open



This repo includes a unit testing file that can be used to test other dates that I haven't thought of
